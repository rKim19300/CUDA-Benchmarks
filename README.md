## NOTE

- This project requires a linux environment to run.

## Making the files

- In the root directory type "make all".

- The files executes will be compiled 
into the same file in which the source file is 
located, thus you must navigate to that directory and then type ./{filename} to run it.

### FILES

- benchmarks/cpu/query/query_cpu.c

    - Prints The specifications of the CPU
    on the machine that runs it.

- benchmarks/gpu/query/query_gpu.cu

    - Prints the specifications of the 
    GPU(s) connected to the host system if there are any.

- benchmarks/gpu/out/benchmarks.out

    - Where the output of benchmarks.cu is printed.

- benchmarks/gpu/benchmarks.cu

    - Runs the benchmarks with different grid and block dimension sizes. 

    - The original tests were ran on a "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU"

        - Test 1: This test utilized the maximum number of threads per block. The grid size was set to 512 (i.e. 1536 mod 512 = 0), or (32 x 16), and divided  the data size by the block size so that it perfectly fit the data with one thread per array index, grid size = (2^20)/512 = 32 x 64.

        - Test 2: This test utilized both the maximum block size and the maximum blocks per SM.  Which was block size = (1024/16) = 64 or 8 x 8 and grid size = (2^20)/64 = 128 x 128.

        - Test 3: This test makes use of the maximum block size per SM, but it wonâ€™t make use of the maximum threads per SM, because no more than one block with 1024 threads will fit the 1536 max threads in the SM. block size = (1024 or 32 x 32).  grid size = (2^20/1024) = 32 x 32.

        - Test 4: Test 4 This test choose random numbers for the block and grid size, being block size =28 x 28  and grid size=37 x 37
